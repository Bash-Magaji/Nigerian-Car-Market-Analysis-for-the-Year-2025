# 4. Data Splitting and Preprocessing

Data Cleaning: The dataset was initially pre-cleaned using Power Query. To ensure a smooth analysis process, I further verified that there were no empty rows or duplicate entries. To enhance readability, I improved the visibility of column headers and cell data, froze the top pane for easier navigation, and converted the dataset into a standard Excel table format, making it more organized and accessible for further analysis.

Data Transformation: During the data transformation phase, I renamed some column headers for clarity, for example, changing Cities.1 to City. I also cleaned and standardized text entries under this column using the Find and Replace function where necessary. Additionally, I formatted the Amount column to display currency values, improving consistency and making the data easier to interpret during analysis.

Data Splitting: In this phase the dataset is divided into two main categories to allowed for a more focused analysis and offered clearer insights into a distinctive aspects of the data.

1. Category One — Independent value

# 9. Post Analysis Recommendations

▪️With over 2,100 units and an average price of ₦4 million, Nigerian used cars clearly dominate the market in both volume and affordability. These cars offer solid performance (209 hp, 3,100 cc) and are mostly automatic (94%), making them attractive to the average buyer. Dealers should continue to prioritize this segment for quick turnover and wide market reach.

▪️Foreign used cars strike a balance between performance and price, averaging ₦8.9 million, 248 hp, and 3,200 cc engine size. Concentrated in urban centers and largely automatic, this segment suits buyers seeking reliability and slightly better specs than local used cars. Stocking SUVs and Toyota models already in high demand may maximize sales potential.

▪️Brand new cars are few (only 23 units), highly priced (₦20.7 million on average), and limited to FCT and Lagos. With modest specs (132 hp, 2,200 cc) and low mileage, they appeal to high-end buyers focused on status, warranty, and near to zero usage history. These should be marketed as premium, low-risk options with added incentives like financing plans or extended service packages.

▪️Toyota leads in every segment, indicating strong brand loyalty and trust. Dealers should prioritize Toyota across new, foreign used, and Nigerian used inventories to match buyer expectations.

▪️Across all categories, SUVs are the top body type and automatic transmissions dominate, showing clear buyer preferences. Stocking more SUVs and automatics aligns with market demand and ensures quicker sales cycles.

▪️While still a small portion of the market, hybrid vehicles are appearing in both used segments. This suggests a slow but emerging interest in fuel-efficient options. Dealer should watch this trend and be ready to diversify as demand grows.

# 10. Conclusion

The analysis reveals a strong, consistent demand for Nigerian and foreign used cars, especially Toyota SUVs with automatic transmissions, across major states. Nigerian used cars dominate in volume and affordability, while foreign used cars appeal to mid income buyers seeking better performance. Brand new cars, though limited in number, target a premium market in Lagos and FCT. Across all segments, buyers show a clear preference for SUVs, automatic drive, and petrol engines, with a small but growing interest in hybrids. Dealers should align inventory and marketing strategies with these insights to maximize reach and profitability.
